###Chosen Theme
This theme was chosen because all the powerpoint slides always have references to potatoes. Thus, I decided to go with a theme of fruits, vegetables and anything that grows underground.

###How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?
All of my searches made used words from things that grow underground. Here are some of the words I used:
*  potatoes
*  potato
*  sweet potato
*  yams
*  radishes
*  onions 
*  ginger 
*  beets
*  garlic
*  celery
*  jicama

###What are known problems, if any, with your project?
One of the known issues is that after a certain time refreshing the page the twitter API key may reach its request limit, thus provoking an error. 

###How would you improve it if you had more time?
One way to improve this web app would be by scaling the images appropriately when being displayed on the screen. Currently it is set to cover 95% of the screen's width and height. Because of this, the images sometimes show that they have not been properly scaled.


### Tech
* [Flask] -  Flask is a microframework for Python
* [Twitter REST API] - provide programmatic access to read and write Twitter data. Create a new Tweet, read user profile and follower data, and more.
* [Getty Images’ REST API] - Allows for the access of free to use images
* [Heroku] - platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
* [Tweepy] - a python library that wraps around the twitter API
